# Hiew Documentation Project

This project is building notes and online help for the [Hiew](http://www.hiew.ru) editor.

The current documentation is online here:

[https://taviso.github.io/hiewdocs/index.htm](https://taviso.github.io/hiewdocs/index.htm)


I think new Hiew users might be discouraged because many features are not
easily discoverable, and Googling for hints is unlikely to find any answers. I
think some searchable online help might help.

> This project is early and ongoing. You can help!

If you're a regular Hiew user, pull Requests, corrections, etc, are all appreciated!
